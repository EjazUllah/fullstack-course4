        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Poverty & Child Labor:</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Child labour exists in the district but in different dimensions. The district does not have any cottage industry or industrial sector where child labour is used. There is only one carpet centre in Zhob city where a few children work. However, the utilisation of child labour is frequent in rural areas. A large number of boys, ranging from the age group 7 to 10, can be seen cutting wood, grazing cattle and cutting fodder. A large number of parents, particularly in Kakar Khurasan and Sherani subdivisions prefer their children to assist them in household and farm duties instead of going to school. Girls are exclusively engaged in household duties and fetching water etc. More than boys they often do not go to school. There is a lack of government support for apprenticeship. The major sources of apprenticeship for boys is the private motor workshops, tailoring shops, carpentry, cooking, and bicycle repair shops where they receive informal training. Such training is observed as very helping to find work in future. In case of girls, they learn embroidery work at home. The government sector and NGOs can play an important role in the promotion of apprenticeship for children.</p>
